## About
This program is made for you to keep a track of your Todos. With an easy user-interface and bug-free program that you can easily use to keep a track of your project and where it is headed.


Very much like a kanban board, this mongoDB database-based program is here to keep you alert on what is going on within your project - what is there TODO, is it done and who's in charge of the TODO task.



## Features

- In this program you are given 6 choices in the meny when you start the program.


    - 1. Create TODO
    - 2. Read All TODOS
    - 3. Read TODO by ID
    - 4. Update existing TODO
    - 5. Delete TODO
    - 6. Exit program.
- Extras:
    - Easy to use interface.
    - Exception handlers for a stable program.
    - A database you can trust and easily access without the program.
## Installation

1. To be able to use this program you will need to download MongoDB and MongoDB compass.
2. Once downloaded you can download/clone this repository to access the code.
3. Once in the program, head to the Main class and start it up.
4. Enjoy.


## Contributers/CREDITS

1. First of all I want to be clear that ChatGPT helped me with hard-to-grasp concepts, cleaning up code, adding clear comments as to what is going on in the code and also translated some language for me so that the user easily can understand what is going on.
2. Secondly I want to give credit to my classmates - because of their endless support, their motivation and lovely attitude. (Especially Johan).

## Reviews:
Jafar reviewed my project and his conclusions were:
1. No problem downloading and simply running the program. 
2. Issues with mixed language and method names.

Johan looked at my Test classes and gave me some advice.
